/**
 * In a company an employee is paid as follows: 
    -> If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. 
    -> If his basic salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. 
    If the Employee's basic salary is given as input, write a program to find his gross salary.
    NOTE: Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + DA
