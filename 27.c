/**
 * Write a C program to evaluate the mean, median, and mode of an array of numbers.
 *  - The Mean (or Average) is calculated by summing all elements in the array and dividing by the number of elements.
 *  - The Median is the middle value of a sorted array. To find it, first sort the array
 *  - The Mode is the element that appears most frequently in the array. There may be:
        - One mode if one element has the highest frequency,
        - Multiple modes if several elements have the same highest frequency,
        - No mode if all elements appear with the same frequency (or if each element appears only once).
