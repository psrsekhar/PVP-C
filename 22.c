/**
 * Find a Peak Element in an Array:
    Given an array of integers, find a peak element in it. An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbors. For corner elements, consider only one neighbor. 
    Example: for input array {5, 10, 20, 15}, 20 is the only peak element; for input array {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}, the peak elements are 20 and 90.
