/**
 * The absolute distance between two integers x1 and x2 is given by | x2 â€“ x1 |.
 * Write a program which sorts an array x[ ] of n integers in ascending order of their absolute distances with a given number z. 
 * For example, given x[ ] = {9, 1, 12, 4, 2} and z = 6, the sorted array will be x[ ] = {4, 9, 2, 1, 12}. 
 * Note that 4 is closest to 6, and 12 is farthest from 6, in terms of absolute distances.
